_Ph.D. Candidate in [Dr. Eirin-Lopez's Environmental Epigenetics Lab](https://environmentalepigenetics.com/), 
Florida International University NSF [CREST-CAChE](https://crestcache.fiu.edu/) Fellow_

I am studying phenotypic plasticity in corals with specific interests in shifts in resilience and the molecular underpinnings of plasticity. I also prioritize the applicability of my research to conservation and restoration efforts. 

### Ph.D. Dissertation Chapters
Chapter 1: Coral environmental memory: causes, mechanisms, and consequences for future reefs [View at Trends in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534721001877) 

Chapter 2: Relationships between phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic variation in two Caribbean _Acropora_ corals [View at Molecular Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17072) [Github repository](https://github.com/eelabfiu/BonaireY1)

_Chapter 3: The influence of pre-exposure to multiple stressors on the acute thermal tolerance of Acropora cervicornis corals (Manuscript is in preparation)_

_Chapter 4: The legacy effect of environmental history on coral physiology, growth rate, and thermal tolerance (Manuscript is in preparation)_
