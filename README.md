# Serena Hackerott
Postdoctoral Researcher in [Dr. Warner's Lab](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/departments/smsp/faculty/mark-warner/) at the [University of Delaware School of Marine Science and Policy](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/departments/smsp/). 


_Previously an NSF [CREST-CAChE](https://crestcache.fiu.edu/) Doctoral Fellow within [Dr. Eirin-Lopez's Environmental Epigenetics Lab](https://environmentalepigenetics.com/) at Florida International University_

I am studying phenotypic plasticity in corals with specific interests in shifts in resilience and the molecular underpinnings of plasticity. I also prioritize the applicability of my research to conservation and restoration efforts.
